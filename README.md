In order to get some practice with Ionic2 and AngularJS 2 I've decided to make blablacar app available in three platforms: 
Android, Windows phone and of course iPhone and iPad. Of course currently it is available on Android and iPhone, but I didn't find blablacar
at Windows phone and didn't find it on iPad. It disappointed me, but also provided me hint for making app that will work with those 
platforms.
